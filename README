Description
===========

This tool is used to incur load on the various OpenStack API's.

Specifically, it creates servers, volumes, retreives their respective statuses, and if
the servers are 'ACTIVE' and volumes 'available', it will attach the volume to
the server and execute the scripts in vm_scripts/ (which creates & interacts
with an instance-based LVM).

The API requests are issued concurrently by using the python multiprocessing
library.



Usage
=====
Required: insert <API>:<PORT> for each API in conf.py

i.e. Openstack account info:

OS_USERNAME='john'
OS_PASSWORD='password'
OS_TENANT_NAME='MyTenant'
OS_TENANT_ID='20acaeea1c2f469d84bc79acbc6cd6b8'

example 1:
$ python multiprocess.py "$OS_USERNAME" "$OS_PASSWORD" "$OS_TENANT_NAME" "$OS_TENANT_ID" <number_of_subprocesses_to_launch> <server_volume_quantity>

example 2:
$ python multiprocess.py 'john' 'password' 'MyTenant' '20acaeea1c2f469d84bc79acbc6cd6b8' 4 30
